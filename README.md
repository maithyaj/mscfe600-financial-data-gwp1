# MScFE 600 Financial Data - Group Work Project #1

## Overview
This repository contains the code, analysis, and reports for **MScFE 600 Financial Data Group Work Project #1**. The project focuses on the application of financial data analysis techniques, including tasks related to data quality assessment, yield curve modeling, correlation analysis, and empirical analysis of ETFs.

## Tasks
The project is divided into four key tasks:

1. **Data Quality**
   - Analyze and provide examples of both structured and unstructured poor-quality financial data.
   - Evaluate how to recognize poor-quality data and its impact on financial analysis.

2. **Yield Curve Modeling**
   - Fit **Nelson-Siegel** and **Cubic-Spline** models to government securities' yield data.
   - Compare the models in terms of fit and interpretation.

3. **Exploiting Correlation**
   - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on simulated and real data to analyze correlations in financial variables.
   - Create scree plots to visualize variance explained by principal components.

4. **Empirical Analysis of ETFs**
   - Analyze the 30 largest holdings of a selected sector ETF.
   - Compute daily returns, covariance, and use PCA and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for further analysis.
